    Level 1:
    puts "Direction: " + warrior.direction_of_stairs.inspect
    puts "Feel: " + warrior.feel(warrior.direction_of_stairs).inspect
    warrior.walk!(warrior.direction_of_stairs)

Level 2 clue:
Call warrior.feel(direction).enemy? in each direction to make sure there isn't
an enemy beside you (attack if there is). Call warrior.rest! if you're low and
health when there are no enemies around.


What I learned:
if a sludge is next to me and I do nothing, I lose 3 health (out of 20)
if a sludge is next to me and I rest, I lose 1 health (out of 20)
if a sludge is next to me and I attack, I lose 3 health (and he loses 5/12)
